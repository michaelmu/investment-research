#### AXON (Axon Enterprise) — public-safety OS + SaaS flywheel

**Thesis (compounder frame):** Axon looks like a classic “mission + platform + switching costs” compounder: it sells must-have frontline hardware (body cams, in-car systems, TASER devices) that feeds a growing, higher-margin software and services layer (digital evidence cloud + productivity/real-time ops). The product suite is designed to be sold as integrated subscriptions, which can deepen retention as agencies standardize workflows around Evidence.com and adjacent modules.

**What the 10‑K says (grounding facts):**
- Axon explicitly frames its strategy as building “highly recurring, highly profitable businesses,” and discloses **annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1.0B as of Dec 31, 2024** (10‑K, **Item 1 — Business**, Software revenue drivers section).
- In MD&A, Axon reports **2024 revenue of $2.082B, up 33.4% YoY** (from $1.561B in 2023), with **services at 41.4% of revenue** and gross margin **59.6%** (10‑K, **Item 7 — MD&A**, Results of Operations table).
- Customer concentration appears limited: **no customer represented >10% of net sales** in 2024/2023/2022 (10‑K, **Item 1 — Business**, Sales and Distribution).

**Growth engine / moat:** The “land” is often a device deployment (camera/TASER) justified by safety/transparency; the “expand” is multi-year cloud evidence storage, workflow software, and add-on modules (records, real-time ops, AI). Once video evidence, chain-of-custody, and case workflows live inside a single system, switching becomes operationally painful, not just financially inconvenient.

**Key risks (and how I’d watch them):**
- **Budget/political cyclicality:** many customers are government agencies; contracts can be terminated for non-appropriation (10‑K, Item 1).
- **Security + AI uncertainty:** the 10‑K highlights breach risk with third-party providers and uncertainty around AI deployment/reputation (10‑K, Item 1A — Risk Factors summary).
- **International / China exposure:** 10‑K shows **15% of 2024 revenue from “Other countries”** (10‑K, Item 7). Specific China exposure is **unknown** from the snippets reviewed; treat as a diligence item.

**10‑year price context (trend only):** AXON shows a **~38% 10y CAGR** with a **max drawdown ~‑58%**; most recently it’s **~‑51% from the 10y high** (price_history.py, stooq, unadjusted). That’s consistent with a high-growth name that can still suffer brutal multiple compression.
