## Copart (CPRT)

## Copart (CPRT) — deep dive (10‑K grounded)

Copart is a vehicle salvage auction + services platform that primarily serves insurance companies. In its FY2025 10‑K, Copart says insurance company sellers provided **81%** of vehicles processed in FY2025 (and **81%/83%** in FY2024/FY2023) (10‑K Item 7 / MD&A). That concentration is a moat-adjacent signal (deep workflow integration) and a real risk (counterparty bargaining power).

### Business model
Copart sells vehicles “primarily over the internet” via its auction technology (VB3) and charges sellers/buyers a mix of auction and auction-related service fees. In most geographies it operates as an **agent** (earning fees), but in some markets it may act as a **principal** (buying and reselling vehicles) (10‑K Item 7 / MD&A).

### Economics (income statement)
From the consolidated statements of income (FY ended July 31):
- **Total revenue**: **$4.647B (2025)** vs **$4.237B (2024)** vs **$3.870B (2023)**
- **Operating income**: **$1.697B (2025)** vs **$1.572B (2024)** vs **$1.487B (2023)**
- **Net income**: **$1.548B (2025)** vs **$1.362B (2024)** vs **$1.238B (2023)**
(10‑K financial statements)

### Moat thesis
Copart compounds via a two-sided marketplace (seller volume ↔ buyer liquidity/price discovery) plus operational infrastructure (yards, towing, title processing, storage) that embeds it in insurer and fleet workflows. Scale improves bidder participation, service levels, and incremental margins as throughput rises.

### Key risks / disconfirming evidence
- Insurers bringing more of the remarketing workflow in-house or pressuring fees.
- Export/import law changes impacting international buyer participation (10‑K Item 1A risk factors discuss international expansion and import/export restrictions).
- Regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs (including AML/anti-corruption/export controls obligations in the industry risk discussion).

### Price context (10y, unadjusted OHLC)
As of 2026‑02‑13 close: ~$37.49; ~42% below the 10y high and below the 200‑day SMA (trend context only; not adjusted for splits/dividends).

**Watchlist:** ADD — CPRT. Marketplace + insurer integration; monitor seller concentration and export/import regulation risk.

**Not financial advice.**
