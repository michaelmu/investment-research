### Copart: salvage-auction marketplace compounding
*Kind:* deep-dive  \ 
*Updated:* 2026-02-17

# Copart (CPRT) — online salvage auctions as a quiet compounding machine

**Thesis (high-growth compounder):** Copart runs a scaled, software-enabled marketplace for damaged/total-loss vehicles and other remarketed vehicles. The business blends network effects (more sellers → more inventory → more buyers → better price discovery) with an asset-backed moat (a growing yard/facility footprint + logistics + title-processing know-how). If salvage volumes keep rising with vehicle complexity and catastrophes, Copart can compound by taking share, adding services, and expanding internationally.

## What the 10‑K says (primary-source facts)
- **Seller mix is highly insurance-driven.** Copart states it obtained **81% of vehicles processed in fiscal 2025** from insurance company sellers (Form 10‑K, **Item 1 — Business**). That’s a strength (repeat volume, standardized workflow) and a concentration risk (pricing power and contract dynamics matter).
- **Profitability is already substantial.** For fiscal 2025, Copart reports **$4.6B of revenue and $1.7B of operating income** (Form 10‑K, **Item 1 — Business**), implying this isn’t a “story stock” — it’s an earnings engine funding reinvestment.
- **Demand is meaningfully global.** Copart notes that in fiscal 2025, **38.8% of U.S. vehicles (unit basis) were sold to international members** (Form 10‑K, **Item 1 — Business**). This supports price discovery, but also increases regulatory/trade/logistics exposure.

## Growth drivers & durability
- **Structural tailwinds:** Newer cars have more expensive components/sensors and are costlier to repair, making total losses more likely (10‑K Item 1 discussion of feature complexity). More total-loss decisions → more supply for Copart’s platform.
- **Operational flywheel:** Copart’s VB3 online auction model increases buyer pool without the cost of live auctions, potentially improving seller returns and keeping sellers sticky (10‑K Item 1).

## Key risks (watch closely)
- **International expansion risk:** Copart explicitly highlights risks from operating outside the U.S. as it expands in Europe, Canada, Brazil, and the Middle East (Form 10‑K, **Item 1A — Risk Factors**).
- **China exposure:** The 10‑K excerpted here does not call out China specifically; **direct China exposure appears low/unknown**, but international buyers could include China indirectly. Treat as a monitoring item.

## Price context (trend only; not adjusted)
Over the last ~10 years, CPRT shows ~**23.7% CAGR** and ~**+739% total return** on unadjusted Stooq OHLC, though it’s currently ~**42% below** the 10‑year high (price_history.py, 10y window).

**WATCHLIST:** **ADD** — Scaled, profitable marketplace with a clear structural tailwind; monitor insurance-seller concentration and international/regulatory risk.

### Copart: ML-driven total-loss + salvage auction flywheel
*Kind:* ai-beneficiary  \

# Copart (CPRT) — AI-enabled salvage auctions (adopter/enabler)

**Category:** adopter (AI inside core workflow) / enabler (data + marketplace infrastructure for claims/salvage)

## AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
Copart runs an online auction marketplace for salvage and used vehicles, tightly integrated into insurers’ total-loss and claims workflows. As insurers push harder on cycle-time reduction and automated claims handling, Copart benefits when machine learning/computer vision improves (1) *total-loss determination*, (2) *salvage value estimation*, and (3) *auction decisioning/price optimization*—all of which increase throughput and seller ROI. Better AI models can reduce “touch labor,” speed release-to-auction, and improve net proceeds, strengthening Copart’s value proposition and retention while expanding attach rate of its software tools.

## Grounded 10-K facts (primary source)
- Copart explicitly offers **Co.ai**, “a proprietary suite of total loss determination and valuation tools that leverage **machine learning and computer vision** … providing online salvage value estimates” to help sellers decide repair vs. total loss (**Item 1 – Salvage Estimation Services**).
- Copart also offers **IntelliSeller**, “an automated tool … Using **machine learning** … to determine when to establish minimum bid values and suggest when to re-auction a unit” to optimize returns and minimize cycle time (**Item 1 – IntelliSeller**).
- Business mix: for FY ended July 31, 2025, Copart generated **83.0% of revenue in the U.S. segment and 17.0% international** (**Item 1 – Our Business Segments**).

## 10-year price / trend context (not adjusted)
Stooq-based 10y window shows ~**23.7% CAGR** and ~**+734.7%** total return, but shares are ~**-41.8% from the high** and **below** the 50d and 200d SMAs (last close **$37.49** vs SMA50 **$39.52**, SMA200 **$45.81**). This reads as a quality compounder currently in a broad drawdown / de-rating phase.

## KPIs to watch
- Vehicle volumes processed/sold; total-loss frequency tailwinds.
- Seller adoption/penetration of **Co.ai** and **IntelliSeller** (any disclosed usage, attach rate, or uplift).
- International revenue mix and FX sensitivity.
- Service revenue per vehicle / take rate; operating leverage as automation increases.

## Main risks
- Tech/AI risk: competitors adopting AI faster; regulatory/legal uncertainty around AI/ML and GenAI use (**Item 1A – Rapid technological changes; emerging AI/ML/GenAI regulatory risks**).
- Cyber/availability risk for an internet auction platform (**Item 1A – IT disruptions/cyber incidents**).
- Regulatory/compliance risk (incl. DOJ money-laundering investigation noted in risk factors) (**Item 1A – Regulation of vehicle sales industry**).
- **China exposure:** no direct China mention found in extracted sections; supply-chain / buyer mix indirect exposure is **unknown** (treat as a monitoring item).

## WATCHLIST action
**WATCHLIST: ACCUMULATE-ON-WEAKNESS (starter position only).** Thesis is intact (AI embedded in core product + insurer automation tailwind). I’d wait for either (a) a trend break back above the 200d SMA, or (b) clear fundamental re-acceleration / margin expansion driven by automation, before sizing up.

### Deep dive (10-K grounded)
*Kind:* deep-dive  \ 
*Updated:* 2026-02-15

## Copart (CPRT) — deep dive (10‑K grounded)

Copart is a vehicle salvage auction + services platform that primarily serves insurance companies. In its FY2025 10‑K, Copart says insurance company sellers provided **81%** of vehicles processed in FY2025 (and **81%/83%** in FY2024/FY2023) (10‑K Item 7 / MD&A). That concentration is a moat-adjacent signal (deep workflow integration) and a real risk (counterparty bargaining power).

### Business model
Copart sells vehicles “primarily over the internet” via its auction technology (VB3) and charges sellers/buyers a mix of auction and auction-related service fees. In most geographies it operates as an **agent** (earning fees), but in some markets it may act as a **principal** (buying and reselling vehicles) (10‑K Item 7 / MD&A).

### Economics (income statement)
From the consolidated statements of income (FY ended July 31):
- **Total revenue**: **$4.647B (2025)** vs **$4.237B (2024)** vs **$3.870B (2023)**
- **Operating income**: **$1.697B (2025)** vs **$1.572B (2024)** vs **$1.487B (2023)**
- **Net income**: **$1.548B (2025)** vs **$1.362B (2024)** vs **$1.238B (2023)**
(10‑K financial statements)

### Moat thesis
Copart compounds via a two-sided marketplace (seller volume ↔ buyer liquidity/price discovery) plus operational infrastructure (yards, towing, title processing, storage) that embeds it in insurer and fleet workflows. Scale improves bidder participation, service levels, and incremental margins as throughput rises.

### Key risks / disconfirming evidence
- Insurers bringing more of the remarketing workflow in-house or pressuring fees.
- Export/import law changes impacting international buyer participation (10‑K Item 1A risk factors discuss international expansion and import/export restrictions).
- Regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs (including AML/anti-corruption/export controls obligations in the industry risk discussion).

### Price context (10y, unadjusted OHLC)
As of 2026‑02‑13 close: ~$37.49; ~42% below the 10y high and below the 200‑day SMA (trend context only; not adjusted for splits/dividends).

**Watchlist:** ADD — CPRT. Marketplace + insurer integration; monitor seller concentration and export/import regulation risk.

**Not financial advice.**
