### Eaton: data-center power stack
<span class="small">ai-beneficiary · 2026-02-26</span>

#### Eaton (ETN) — “Data-center power stack” enabler

**Category:** Pickaxe / enabler (electrical infrastructure for AI data centers)

##### AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
AI training/inference growth is driving a step-change in **data-center power density** and **electrical complexity** (utility interconnects, switchgear, breakers, busway, UPS/power quality, distribution, monitoring). Eaton is positioned as a core supplier across that power chain. The specific AI linkage is not “Eaton uses AI,” but that **AI workloads require more megawatts per site**, which pulls forward multi‑year spend on electrical equipment and services. This is a 2nd‑order beneficiary: hyperscalers and colocation players spend on compute, then must build/upgrade the power room to match.

##### 10‑K grounding (primary-source facts)
- Eaton explicitly highlights **data centers** as a key end market: it “make[s] products for the **data center**, utility, industrial, commercial…” markets and is “benefiting from momentum in the **data center** and utility end markets” (Item 1, *Business*).
- Scale/financial context: Eaton reports “revenues of **nearly $25 billion in 2024**” and serves customers in “more than **160 countries**” (Item 1, *Business*).
- Customer concentration reminder (useful for cycle risk): in 2024, **Electrical Americas + Electrical Global** had **26% of sales to eight large customers** of electrical products/systems/services (Item 1, segment discussion).
- Risk framing: Eaton notes it supports “cutting edge technology… including… **data centers**” and that abrupt disruptive technologies could negatively impact end markets and its stock price (Item 1A, *Risk Factors — Technology disruption*).

##### Price/trend context (10y)
ETN has been in a strong long-duration uptrend: ~**24% 10‑yr CAGR**, last close **$391.91**, about **4% below** its 10‑yr high, and **~12% above** its 200‑day SMA (stooq; not dividend-adjusted).

##### Key KPIs to watch
- Electrical segment **organic sales growth** and **operating margin** (especially any commentary on data-center mix).
- **Backlog / orders** trends in Electrical (if disclosed) and lead-time normalization.
- Working capital: **inventory** and **receivables** (signal of demand vs channel fill).

##### Main risks
- **China exposure:** Eaton is global (160+ countries; manufacturing in 34 countries per Item 2). Specific China revenue/supply-chain dependency is **unknown from the excerpts reviewed**—treat as a diligence risk (especially for electronics/components).
- Capex cycle risk: data-center builds can pause; customer concentration can amplify volatility.
- Supply chain / commodity input costs (copper, steel, electronic components) and pricing power (Item 1 + Item 1A).

##### WATCHLIST action
**WATCH / Accumulate on pullbacks**: keep ETN on the AI-infrastructure watchlist; look for confirmation via sustained Electrical growth and management commentary that data-center demand remains incremental (not merely cyclical catch-up).

### Eaton: power gear for AI data centers
<span class="small">ai-beneficiary · 2026-02-20</span>

#### Eaton (ETN) — electrical power "pickaxes" for AI data centers

**Category:** Pickaxe / enabler (power distribution, protection, and electrical systems that scale data center capacity)

##### AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
AI training/inference growth increases **data center power density** and accelerates the buildout/retrofit cycle for electrical infrastructure (switchgear, breakers, UPS/power management, monitoring). Eaton’s upside is largely **2nd-order**: it sells the “power side” of compute—equipment and systems that must be installed before GPU racks can be energized safely and reliably. If hyperscalers and colocation providers keep expanding capacity, Eaton should see higher demand in its electrical segments via project-driven orders, pull-through service, and pricing/mix benefits in higher-spec gear.

##### Grounded 10‑K facts (primary source)
- Eaton describes itself as an “**intelligent power management company**” and explicitly lists making products for the **data center** market, alongside utility/industrial/commercial/aerospace and mobility end markets (10‑K **Item 1: Business**).
- Eaton reports **revenues of nearly $25 billion in 2024** and states it serves customers in **more than 160 countries** (10‑K **Item 1: Business**).
- China exposure to note: Eaton discloses equity-method investments in China, including a **50% stake in Jiangsu Huineng Electric’s circuit breaker business** and a **49% stake in Jiangsu Ryan Electrical (transformers)** (10‑K **Item 8: Financial Statements, Note 2 — Acquisitions**). These may be non-controlling, but they are direct China-linked assets.

##### Price/trend context (10y)
ETN has compounded strongly over the last decade (10y **CAGR ~23.8%**; last close **$391.91** vs 10y low **~$44.45**). Shares are ~**4% below** the 10y high and above 50/200d SMAs (~15% / ~12%), suggesting an extended but still upward trend.

##### KPIs to watch
- Electrical segment **organic sales / orders / backlog** (especially data center & utility commentary)
- **Operating margin** in Electrical Americas/Global (mix + pricing vs input costs)
- **Copper/steel** inflation passthrough (gross margin resilience)
- Data center capex signals: hyperscaler/colo buildouts, power-availability constraints

##### Main risks
- **China exposure:** disclosed equity stakes in Chinese manufacturing (Item 8, Note 2). If “avoid China” is strict, treat as a material diligence item.
- End-market cyclicality and “**technology disruption**” impacting data-center-related demand (10‑K **Item 1A: Risk Factors**).
- Supply chain/input cost volatility (metals/components) and project timing risk (Item 1A).

##### WATCHLIST action
**WATCH** (not a fresh add on valuation alone after a big run). Bias to add on: (1) evidence of sustained data center orders/backlog, and (2) multiple compression / pullback without margin deterioration. If China exposure is unacceptable, **defer** pending position-level disclosure and segment materiality.
