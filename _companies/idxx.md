#### IDEXX (IDXX) — sticky consumables + integrated workflow as a veterinary compounder

**10-K anchor:** IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Form 10‑K (accession **0000874716-26-000038**), filed **2026‑02‑20** for fiscal year ended **2025‑12‑31** (report date **2025‑12‑31**).

IDEXX is a classic “razor/razorblade + software workflow” business in veterinary diagnostics: instruments placed into clinics drive recurring consumables, reference-lab pull-through, and practice software that keeps the whole workflow inside one ecosystem. In **Item 1 (Business)**, IDEXX describes its primary companion animal offering as point‑of‑care diagnostic instruments plus **associated consumables** and rapid assay kits, alongside reference-lab services and practice management software — effectively a bundled diagnostic stack rather than a single product line. It also notes that several flagship analyzers (Catalyst One, ProCyte One, SediVue Dx, inVue Dx) incorporate **proprietary AI capabilities** for image capture/analysis (Item 1), which matters less for “AI hype” and more for switching costs: diagnostic outputs are integrated into cloud tools like VetConnect PLUS (Item 1).

Two grounding facts from the filing that frame durability/risk:

- **Scale + reach:** as of **Dec 31, 2025**, IDEXX had **~11,000 employees across ~34 countries** (Item 1). That breadth supports a global lab network and installed base servicing model.
- **Supplier concentration:** IDEXX discloses that certain Catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by **Ortho‑Clinical Diagnostics under agreements set to expire in December 2044**, with provisions that can extend supply for up to **twelve years** after a non‑extension notice (Item 1). This is a real “single-source” dependency risk, but also signals long-lived, contractually structured supply for a core consumable.

**10y price context (trend only):** last close **$658.62** (2026‑02‑27). 10‑year total return about **+800%** with estimated **~24.6% CAGR**; currently ~**14.5%** below the 10‑year high, and slightly above the 200‑day moving average (price_history.py; not adjusted for splits/dividends).

**China exposure check:** the 10‑K references China in the context of international regulatory regimes and global sales presence (Item 1). It does not, in the excerpts reviewed, quantify revenue/profit exposure by country. **Label: unknown** — treat as a diligence item (distribution, manufacturing inputs, and regulatory risk).

**Watchlist action:** **ADD** — high-quality diagnostics + consumables flywheel with workflow/software moat; diligence supplier concentration (Ortho slides) and quantify China/Asia revenue exposure.
