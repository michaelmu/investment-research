### AI-driven expert platform compounder
<span class="small">deep-dive · 2026-02-23</span>

#### Intuit (INTU) — “AI-driven expert platform” compounder under pressure

**What it is:** Intuit is a financial technology platform spanning small-business accounting (QuickBooks), consumer tax (TurboTax), personal finance lead-gen/membership (Credit Karma), and SMB marketing (Mailchimp). The core compounding engine is workflow software + embedded services (payments, payroll, capital) with recurring revenue characteristics and high customer switching costs.

**Why it can compound:** Intuit’s pitch is moving from “software you use” to a **done-for-you** operating system for money workflows. In its FY2025 10-K, management frames the strategy as an “AI-driven expert platform” that connects customers to AI agents plus AI-enabled human experts (Item 1, Business). If this vision lands, it expands Intuit’s addressable market per customer (more jobs-to-be-done) while deepening retention.

**Grounding facts from the 10-K (primary source):**
- Intuit says it serves **~100 million** consumers, small/mid-market businesses, and accountants worldwide (FY2025 10‑K, **Item 1**).
- Segment mix shows the business is already anchored by SMB: **Global Business Solutions was 59% of FY2025 revenue** (Consumer 26%, Credit Karma 12%, ProTax 3%), and **international net revenue was ~8%** of consolidated revenue (FY2025 10‑K, **Item 1**).

**Key risks (watch closely):**
- **Cybersecurity / sensitive data:** Intuit explicitly notes it hosts and retains highly sensitive data (including SSNs, tax return info, bank account numbers, credit report info, and payroll data) and that security protections “cannot provide absolute security” (FY2025 10‑K, **Item 1A, Operational Risks**). A major incident could hit trust, regulators, and churn.
- **Credit Karma regulatory overhang:** Intuit discloses Credit Karma member data is subject to a **2014 FTC order** requiring a comprehensive security program and biennial independent assessments for 20 years; noncompliance could lead to fines/penalties (FY2025 10‑K, **Item 1A**).

**10-year price context (trend only):** The 10-year summary shows ~**14.4% CAGR** and ~**283% total return**, but the stock is currently ~**56% below** its 10-year high and below key moving averages (price_history.py, Stooq; unadjusted OHLC).

**China exposure:** Not highlighted in the extracted sections; treat as **unknown**. International revenue is ~8%, but geographic concentration inside that isn’t specified here.

**WATCHLIST: KEEP** — Category-leading SMB + tax platform with credible AI/workflow expansion, but validate security execution and any regulatory headlines.
