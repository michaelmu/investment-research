###### AI capex becomes concrete
*Kind:* ai-beneficiary  \

#### Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) — “AI capex becomes concrete”

**Company / ticker:** Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (**MLM**)  
**Category:** **Pickaxe / enabler** (heavy materials upstream of AI-driven buildout)

##### AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
The AI buildout is physically constrained by *sites, power, and concrete*. Hyperscale data centers and the grid/transport upgrades around them require huge volumes of aggregates (base layers, concrete input) plus cement and asphalt. If AI capex keeps shifting from “chips” to “chips + buildings + power corridors,” MLM benefits as a largely domestic, aggregates-led supplier positioned in fast-growing U.S. metros where data centers cluster.

##### Grounded 10‑K facts (primary source)
- **Scale + mix:** MLM operates a network of **~390 quarries, mines and distribution yards in 28 states** (plus Canada and The Bahamas). In 2024, **aggregates gross profit was 76% of total reportable segment gross profit** (Item 1 – *Business*).
- **End-market support from public spending:** **37% of 2024 aggregates shipments** were sold in connection with **highway and other public infrastructure** projects (Item 1 – *Business*).
- **Data center adjacency explicitly cited:** management notes technology companies view key Sunbelt transportation corridors as attractive locations for **data centers** (Item 7 – *MD&A, Strategic Objectives*).

##### Key KPIs to watch
- Aggregates **shipments (tons)** and **average selling price** (pricing power is the story).
- Mix of **public infrastructure vs. private nonresidential** demand (data centers sit in the latter).
- **Gross profit per ton / margin** in aggregates.
- **Capex** (plant/haul/logistics) and acquisition integration outcomes.

##### Main risks
- **Construction cyclicality** and rate sensitivity (nonresidential can swing fast).
- **Permitting / environmental** constraints and reclamation obligations.
- Weather volatility disrupting production (explicitly discussed in Item 1).
- **China exposure:** No meaningful China dependency was identified in the extracted sections; only a generic geopolitical reference (Item 1A mentions potential China–Taiwan conflict). Treat supply-chain second-order effects as an ongoing risk.

##### Price / trend context (10y)
MLM’s 10-year total return is **~+409%** (CAGR **~17.7%**). Last close **~$671**, about **‑5.6% from the 10y high (~$711)** and **~11% above the 200‑day SMA** (trend positive; still cyclical).

##### WATCHLIST action
**Watch / accumulate on cyclic pullbacks** if aggregates pricing stays resilient and management commentary continues to call out data-center-driven nonres demand. Re-check quarterly: shipments vs pricing (is AI buildout tightening local aggregates markets?).
