### Workflow compounding + big RPO backlog
<span class="small">deep-dive · 2026-02-26</span>

#### ServiceNow (NOW) — workflow “system of action” for the AI era

ServiceNow is an enterprise workflow automation platform that sits between “insight” (data/AI) and “execution” (approvals, routing, updates to systems of record). The company frames its moat as durable enterprise relationships plus a single platform architecture that connects people, processes, and data across departments (IT, security, HR, finance, customer service, etc.). The core bet is that as AI proliferates, enterprises need *governed orchestration* more than yet another model—i.e., tooling that turns AI output into compliant, auditable work.

**What the 10‑K says (grounding facts):**
- **Visibility into forward revenue is sizable.** As of **Dec 31, 2025, remaining performance obligations (RPO) were $28.2B, with 46% expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months** (10‑K Item 7 / MD&A, “Remaining performance obligations”). Management also notes RPO and current RPO grew **27% and 25% YoY**, respectively (same section).
- **Revenue model is subscription-first with sticky contract terms.** The company states it derives revenue “predominately from subscription revenues,” recognized ratably over the subscription term for cloud services; and that customer contracts are **generally non‑cancellable** during the term (10‑K Item 7 / MD&A, “Subscription revenues”).
- **Go-to-market remains heavily direct.** Revenues from the direct sales organization represented **78% of total revenues in 2025 and 2024** (10‑K Item 7 / MD&A, “Revenues from our direct sales organization”).

**Price context (not fundamentals, just tape):**
Over the last 10 years, NOW shows a strong compounding profile: **~25.3% 10‑yr CAGR** and **~+848% total return** (Stooq data via price_history tool). The stock is currently **~56% below its 10‑yr high** and **below both 50‑ and 200‑day SMAs**, implying the market is discounting growth durability/valuation (trend context only).

**China exposure:** Not explicitly called out in the extracted 10‑K sections I reviewed; treat **China exposure as unknown** (risk: international customers, partners, and FX).

**Thesis in one line:** If ServiceNow keeps winning as the cross‑enterprise workflow control plane (especially for AI governance + orchestration), it can compound via multi‑product expansion inside large customers with high switching costs.

**WATCHLIST: ADD** — High-quality subscription compounder with large contracted backlog (RPO) and strong long-run price compounding; currently in a major drawdown worth monitoring for re‑entry.

### Workflow layer for the AI era
<span class="small">deep-dive · 2026-02-24</span>

#### ServiceNow (NOW) — workflow layer for the AI era

**Thesis (compounder lens):** ServiceNow sells a mission‑critical, sticky “workflow operating system” for large enterprises. As companies deploy more AI, the scarce piece is not insight generation—it’s *governed execution* across systems of record. That is exactly what ServiceNow’s platform is built to orchestrate, which can support durable multi-year expansion (more modules, more seats, more workflows) inside a customer base that tends to standardize on one platform.

**What the business is:** ServiceNow provides a cloud platform that connects people, processes, and data to automate cross‑functional workflows (IT, security, risk, CRM/service, HR, finance, etc.) and is positioning “Now Assist” and AI agents as a productivity layer on top (10‑K Item 1: Business). The practical moat is deep integration + workflow orchestration that’s hard to rip out once embedded in day‑to‑day operations.

**Two grounding facts from the latest 10‑K:**
- **Backlog / durability:** As of **Dec 31, 2025, remaining performance obligations (RPO) were $28.2B**, and **46%** was expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months; management also states RPO and current RPO grew **27%** and **25%** year over year (10‑K **Item 7**: MD&A, “Remaining performance obligations”).
- **Large-customer expansion:** ServiceNow reports **603 customers with ACV > $5M** as of Dec 31, 2025 (up from 502 in 2024) (10‑K **Item 7**: MD&A, “Number of customers with ACV greater than $5 million”).

**Growth/quality signals to watch:** The business is predominantly subscription revenue with multi‑year contracts and generally non‑cancellable terms (10‑K Item 7 discusses subscription revenue recognition and contracting structure). International revenue is meaningful: sales outside North America were **37% of total revenues** in 2025 (10‑K Item 1A / risk discussion references this), so FX and regional execution matter.

**Price context (not advice):** Over the last 10 years, NOW shows ~**25% CAGR** and ~**57% max drawdown**; it is currently ~**56% below** its 10‑year high per the unadjusted price history snapshot (stooq via `price_history.py`). This supports “great business, volatile stock” expectations.

**China exposure:** *Unknown.* The 10‑K excerpted here emphasizes international exposure in aggregate (37% outside North America), but does not clearly quantify China specifically. Treat as a diligence item (customer mix, partners, data residency).

**Risks (headline):** platform competition (hyperscalers / SaaS suites), AI execution risk (quality, governance, security), and international/regulatory complexity.

**WATCHLIST:** **ADD** — high-quality enterprise workflow platform with strong RPO and increasing >$5M ACV customers; diligence China-specific exposure and valuation sensitivity.

### Workflow OS for the AI era
<span class="small">deep-dive · 2026-02-22</span>

#### ServiceNow (NOW) — workflow “operating system” for the AI era

*Not financial advice.*

##### Why it’s an interesting compounder
ServiceNow is essentially selling a horizontal “workflow OS” for large enterprises: a single platform that connects people, processes, and data so work can be automated across IT, security, customer service, HR/finance, and industry workflows. The durable part isn’t just features—it’s the integration layer and the governance/controls enterprises need when workflows span many systems of record.

In its latest 10‑K, management frames AI as an accelerant: AI is good at generating information, but turning that into outcomes requires orchestration, approvals, compliance rules, and integrations across systems (10‑K, Item 1 “Business” overview). That positioning matters because it’s aligned to where AI deployments often stall—execution and governance, not “answers.”

##### What the 10‑K says (grounded facts)
- **Scale and customer base:** As of **Dec 31, 2025**, ServiceNow reported **~8,700 customers** (10‑K, Item 1 “Business”). This supports the idea that it’s already a mainstream platform inside large orgs, not a niche point product.
- **Revenue model and growth:** For FY **2025**, ServiceNow reported **$13.278B total revenue**, with **$12.883B (97%)** from subscriptions, up **21%** year‑over‑year (10‑K, Item 7 “MD&A — Revenues”). A subscription-heavy mix is typical of compounding software models when retention + expansion are strong.
- **Forward demand indicator:** ServiceNow disclosed **$28.2B** of total non‑cancellable **remaining performance obligations (RPO)** and expects to recognize **~46% within the next 12 months** (10‑K, Item 8, Note “Deferred Revenue and Performance Obligations”). RPO isn’t revenue, but it is a concrete signal of contracted backlog.

##### Risks / watch‑outs
- **Valuation + cyclicality:** High‑multiple software can de-rate in risk-off environments even if fundamentals remain healthy.
- **Execution risk in AI packaging/pricing:** The 10‑K highlights competitive intensity and evolving pricing models (10‑K, Item 1A “Risk Factors”). If “agentic AI” becomes commoditized, differentiation must come from workflow depth and trust.
- **China exposure:** ServiceNow operates internationally and has data centers in Asia (10‑K, Item 1 mentions global data centers). **Direct China revenue exposure is not clearly quantified in the extracted sections → treat as *unknown* and a risk** under the mandate.

##### 10‑year price context (trend only)
Over the last ~10 years, NOW shows a **~25.7% CAGR** with a **~57% max drawdown** and is currently **~56% below** its prior high (price_history.py summary; unadjusted OHLC). This looks like a classic compounder chart with violent cycles—useful context for entry timing discipline.

##### WATCHLIST
**Action: KEEP / ADD** — High-quality subscription compounder with a clear “AI needs workflow orchestration + governance” wedge; monitor for any disclosed China concentration and for AI monetization durability.
