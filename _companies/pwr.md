### Powering the AI buildout (grid + data centers)

#### Quanta Services (PWR) — powering the AI buildout (grid + data centers)

**Company / Ticker:** Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR)  
**Category:** *Pickaxe / enabler* (critical infrastructure services behind AI)

##### AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
AI training/inference is translating into **physical buildout**: (1) more data centers, (2) larger/denser load centers, and (3) the associated **grid interconnect, substations, transmission, and on-site generation** needed to reliably feed them. Quanta benefits as a scaled, labor-and-equipment-heavy contractor that can deliver “critical path” electrical and related infrastructure work that must happen regardless of which chip/cloud/software stack wins.

Quanta’s 10‑K explicitly links data centers and AI to demand: it cites increased electricity demand “as a result of … data center” buildouts and notes that customer investment to expand data centers to “develop artificial intelligence (AI) training and inference” increases demand for Quanta’s offerings (Item 1, *Business – Business Environment*).

##### Grounded 10‑K facts (primary source)
- Quanta provides **“low voltage electrical, mechanical, plumbing and process infrastructure for large load centers, such as data center”** and also highlights turnkey electrical systems for large load centers including data centers (Item 1, *Business – Overview / Electric segment*).
- **Technology, Manufacturing and Communications customers were 13% of total revenues in 2025** (up from 9% in 2024) (Item 1, *Business – Customer Relationships*).
- Concentration is real: **largest customer was 8%** and **top ten customers were 30%** of 2025 revenue (Item 1, *Business – Customer Relationships*).
- Contract execution risk is meaningful: Quanta states it has many **fixed price contracts**, including **“data center facility projects,”** where cost estimation errors can drive margin volatility (Item 1A, *Risk Factors – projects / fixed price contracts*). It also discloses **$983.6M of unapproved change orders and claims** as of 12/31/2025 (Item 1A, *Risk Factors – change orders/claims*).

##### 10‑year price context (trend only)
PWR has been in a strong long-term uptrend: ~**40.5% CAGR** over ~10 years and sits **~2.3% below its 10y high** (last close **$552.66** vs high **$565.93**), above both the 50‑day and 200‑day SMAs (price history tool; unadjusted).

##### Key KPIs to watch
- Backlog / remaining performance obligations tied to **data centers + grid** work
- Mix and margin in Electric vs Underground & Infrastructure segments
- Labor availability/turnover and productivity (crew utilization)
- Working capital intensity: change orders/claims, DSO, cash conversion

##### Main risks
- Project timing/cancellations; fixed‑price execution risk on large/complex builds (Item 1A)
- Customer concentration and utility capex cycles (Item 1)
- Labor constraints and wage inflation (Item 1A)
- **China exposure:** no China revenue or operations were flagged by a text search of the extracted 10‑K; however, **materials/components (e.g., solar panels, electrical components) can have global supply chains**—treat supply-chain dependence as an *unknown* risk absent a more detailed sourcing breakdown.

##### WATCHLIST action
**WATCHLIST: Accumulate-on-pullbacks / track for entry**. If the AI-driven data center + grid spend wave persists, Quanta is a durable “shovel seller.” Prefer adding when valuation cools or when execution/claims risk is priced in.
