### Cooling + controls toll-booth on AI data centers

#### Trane Technologies (TT) — the “cooling + controls” toll-booth on AI data centers

**Category:** pickaxe / enabler

**Thesis (AI tailwind mechanism):** The AI buildout is an electricity-to-heat conversion business. As hyperscalers and colocation operators deploy more dense GPU clusters, they need more *thermal management* (air and increasingly liquid) plus smarter facility controls to hit uptime/efficiency targets. Trane is positioned as a “second-order” AI beneficiary because it sells the HVAC systems, liquid cooling solutions, and building/data-center controls that translate capex into operable compute.

**10-K grounding (FY2025 10-K):** Trane explicitly lists **“data center HVAC systems,” “data center liquid cooling solutions,” and “data center facility controls”** within its product/service portfolio (Item 1, *Business*). It also calls out **“Smart and AI-enabled services”** as part of its offerings (Item 1, *Business*). On the financial side, Trane reported **2025 net revenues of $21,321.9M (+7.5% YoY)** and **operating income of $3,967.4M** (Item 7, *MD&A – Consolidated Results*). It ended 2025 with **order backlog of $7,769.4M** (Americas $6,298.6M; EMEA $775.9M; Asia Pacific $694.9M) and expects to ship a majority during 2026 (Item 1, *Backlog*).

**Key KPIs to track:**
- Backlog level and mix (esp. Americas commercial HVAC).
- Organic revenue growth (management reports volume vs pricing in Item 7).
- Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins (Item 7): Americas 21.6%, EMEA 18.3%, Asia Pac 23.9% (FY2025).
- Data-center exposure signals: mentions of liquid cooling attach-rate, controls/software/services growth, large-project wins.

**Risks / watch-outs:**
- **China exposure constraint:** The 10-K indicates global operations and an Asia Pacific segment; it does *not* clearly quantify China-specific revenue in the excerpts reviewed. Treat **China revenue/supply-chain dependency as UNKNOWN** until we pull the geographic note detail; potential risk via components/electronics sourcing and end-market demand.
- Cyclicality in commercial construction; project deferrals/cancellations can shift timing (Item 1, *Backlog*).
- Component shortages/electronics constraints and commodity inflation (Item 1A, *Risk Factors*).
- Competitive pressure and technology shifts (including AI-enabled building tech) (Item 1A).

**10-year price context (trend only):** 10Y CAGR ~**28.4%**; last close **$462.32** (2026-02-27), ~**3.6%** below 10Y high; trading ~**9.5%** above 200D SMA (price_history summary; OHLC unadjusted).

**WATCHLIST action:** **ADD (candidate)** — fits “AI beneficiaries” via data center cooling + controls. Before sizing conviction: verify China revenue concentration and critical supplier geography from the full 10-K notes.
