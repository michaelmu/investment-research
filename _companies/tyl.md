### Sticky public-sector software + payments rails
<span class="small">deep-dive · 2026-02-28</span>

#### Tyler Technologies (TYL) — sticky public-sector software + payments rails

**SEC grounding (10‑K):** Form 10‑K filed **2026‑02‑18** for fiscal year ended **2025‑12‑31** (accession **0000860731-26-000016**).

Tyler Technologies is a focused “government operating system” provider: integrated software and technology management for **local/state/federal** agencies across ERP, courts/public safety, payments, data, and citizen-facing digital services (Item 1).

##### Why it can compound
- **Recurring, mission‑critical workflow + switching costs.** Tyler describes “deep, long-term relationships” with public agencies and a “significant base of recurring revenue” (Item 1). In 2025, **recurring revenues (subscription + maintenance/support) were $2.0B, or 87% of total revenue** (Item 1).
- **Cloud + platform pull-through.** The company is pushing “cloud-first” and migrating hosting to **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** (Item 1), which can improve deployment repeatability and margin structure over time.
- **Payments + transaction fees as an embedded rail.** Tyler calls its payments offering the “leading integrated payments platform” for its public-sector clients, **processing nearly half a billion transactions annually** (Item 1). Transaction-based fees (payments, digital government, e-filing) can scale with usage rather than headcount.

##### What to watch / key risks
- **Cybersecurity and AI-enabled threat surface.** Tyler explicitly warns that cyber-attacks (including state-sponsored actors) and AI can accelerate and amplify threats; breaches “have disrupted” operations in the past and could impair service delivery and harm reputation (Item 1A).
- **Third-party concentration (AWS).** A “material portion” of hosting is on third parties including AWS; outages and provider changes could cause service interruption, client dissatisfaction, and liability (Item 1A).
- **China exposure:** **Unknown.** The 10‑K emphasizes U.S. public-sector clients and notes international presence (e.g., Canada/UK/Australia) and employees in Canada/Philippines/India (Item 1). If any revenue, suppliers, or data hosting ties to China exist, treat as a diligence item.

##### Price context (trend only; not fundamentals)
Over the last ~10 years (to 2026‑02‑27), the stock shows an **~11.4% CAGR** and **~195% total return**, but also a **~55.6% max drawdown**; it is currently **~46% below the decade high** and **~29% below the 200‑day SMA** (stooq; unadjusted OHLC).

##### Watchlist action
**ADD —** US public-sector software + payments platform with very high recurring mix; diligence: China exposure, contract renewal dynamics, and security/outage track record.
