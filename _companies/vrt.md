### Power & cooling leverage to AI densification
<span class="small">ai-beneficiary · 2026-02-23</span>

#### Vertiv (VRT) — “Power & cooling leverage to AI densification”

**Category:** Pickaxe / enabler (critical digital infrastructure).

##### AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
AI training/inference is pushing **higher rack power density** and more stringent uptime requirements in data centers. That directly increases demand for Vertiv’s **power management (UPS/switchgear/busway)** and **thermal management (air + liquid cooling)** systems, plus recurring services. The “second/third-order” angle: even if specific GPU/accelerator winners rotate, **watts and heat still have to be delivered and removed**, and AI densification tends to make the infrastructure bill (and complexity) rise.

##### 10‑K grounding (primary-source facts)
- Vertiv positions itself as “**first-to-market designs engineered for next-gen rack-scale artificial intelligence (AI) compute**,” offering end-to-end power and cooling technologies for data centers and networks (**Item 1 — Business**).
- Demand has translated into a sharply higher order book: **combined order backlog was $15.0B at Dec 31, 2025 vs $7.2B at Dec 31, 2024**, and management expects most of it to ship within **12–18 months** (**Item 1 — Backlog**; also discussed in **Item 1A** risk factor on backlog realization).
- Scale/commitment to innovation: **ER&D spend was $441.7M in 2025** (**Item 1 — Engineering, Research and Development**).
- Geographic mix flags non-trivial Asia exposure: 2025 net sales were **$10.23B**, with **20% transacted in Asia Pacific** (**Item 1 — Business / Segments**).

##### Price context (trend only; not adjusted)
Over the last ~10 years available in the tool window (data from 2018-07-31), VRT shows **very strong uptrend**: ~**53.5% CAGR**, last close **$250.55**, ~**2% below** the period high (**$255.54**) and **~66% above** its 200‑day SMA (**price_history tool; 10y window**).

##### KPIs to watch
- Backlog growth vs conversion (book-to-bill; cancellations/deferrals).
- Data center revenue mix and services attach/renewal rates.
- Gross margin trajectory (pricing vs component/expedite costs).
- Working capital (inventory + receivables) as capacity ramps.

##### Main risks (incl. China constraint)
- **China/Asia-Pacific exposure:** 20% of sales transacted in Asia Pacific; the filing also describes a meaningful manufacturing footprint there (**Item 1**). **China-specific revenue/supply-chain dependency is not clearly quantified in the extracted sections** → treat as **UNKNOWN** and a key diligence item.
- Cyclicality/air pockets if AI capex pauses; Vertiv explicitly calls out sensitivity to “shifts in the level or focus of spending on artificial intelligence” (**Item 1A — Risk Factors**).
- Execution risk on large, penalty-bearing projects and supply constraints (**Item 1A**).

##### WATCHLIST action
**WATCH (not add yet):** Keep on the AI infrastructure list, but **require a China-exposure pass** (revenue + sourcing + manufacturing) before upgrading to “low-China-risk” status. If backlog converts cleanly and margins hold while capex expands, VRT remains a prime AI-densification pickaxe.

### Vertiv: power & cooling pickaxe for AI data centers
*Kind:* ai-beneficiary  \

#### Vertiv (VRT) — Power & cooling “pickaxe” for AI data centers

**Company / Ticker / Category:** Vertiv (NYSE: **VRT**) — **pickaxe/enabler** (critical digital infrastructure: power, thermal, racks, services).

##### AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
AI training/inference pushes **rack power density** and heat loads higher than traditional enterprise compute. That forces faster spend on **power distribution (UPS/switchgear/busbar)** and especially **advanced cooling (incl. liquid cooling)** inside new hyperscale/colo/neocloud builds and retrofits. Vertiv monetizes this as (1) higher equipment content per MW deployed, (2) services attach (maintenance/monitoring), and (3) backlog conversion as customers place orders earlier to reserve capacity.

##### 10-K grounded facts (primary source)
- Vertiv states it “**leads with first-to-market designs engineered for next-gen rack-scale artificial intelligence (“AI”) compute**” and provides end-to-end power and cooling technologies for data centers and networks (**Item 1 — Business**).
- **2025 net sales were $10,229.9 million**, with **62% transacted in the Americas** and **20% in Asia Pacific** (**Item 1 — Business**). *China-specific revenue is not broken out here; treat regional exposure as a risk/unknown.*
- Vertiv reports **estimated combined order backlog of ~$15.0B as of Dec 31, 2025** (vs. $7.2B prior year) and says the majority is expected to ship within **12–18 months** (**Item 1 — Business; Item 1A — “We may not realize all of the sales expected from our backlog…”**).
- Vertiv spent **$441.7 million** on engineering/R&D in 2025 (**Item 1 — Business, ER&D**).

##### Price history context (trend only)
Stooq-based 10Y window (available since 2018-07-31): **~53.5% CAGR**, last close **$250.55**, ~**2% below** the period high (**$255.54**). Note: tool output is **not adjusted** for splits/dividends.

##### Key KPIs to watch
- Backlog level and **conversion / cancellations** (especially hyperscale/neocloud).
- Data-center end-market mix; evidence of **liquid cooling** adoption and attach rates.
- **Gross margin** and price/cost passthrough (materials, freight, labor).
- Services growth (recurring-ish) vs. product growth (more cyclical).

##### Main risks
- Demand timing: Vertiv explicitly flags variability from **AI spending shifts** and long sales cycles (**Item 1A**).
- Backlog risk: customers can **reduce/defer** firm orders; pricing changes may lag due to large backlog (**Item 1A**).
- Supply chain / global operations: significant manufacturing footprint across regions; exposure to tariffs/export controls and emerging-market volatility (**Item 1A**).
- **China exposure:** Asia Pacific is 20% of 2025 sales (Item 1). China-specific supply chain/revenue dependency is **unclear from extracted sections** → treat as **unknown**.

##### WATCHLIST action
**WATCHLIST — Accumulate only on pullbacks / verify China linkage.** Before sizing, do a deeper pass on notes/segment disclosures for PRC revenue, supplier concentration, and any export-control sensitivity.
