###### Vertiv: power & cooling pickaxe for AI data centers
*Kind:* ai-beneficiary  \ 
*Updated:* 2026-02-18

#### Vertiv (VRT) — Power & cooling “pickaxe” for AI data centers

**Company / Ticker / Category:** Vertiv (NYSE: **VRT**) — **pickaxe/enabler** (critical digital infrastructure: power, thermal, racks, services).

##### AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
AI training/inference pushes **rack power density** and heat loads higher than traditional enterprise compute. That forces faster spend on **power distribution (UPS/switchgear/busbar)** and especially **advanced cooling (incl. liquid cooling)** inside new hyperscale/colo/neocloud builds and retrofits. Vertiv monetizes this as (1) higher equipment content per MW deployed, (2) services attach (maintenance/monitoring), and (3) backlog conversion as customers place orders earlier to reserve capacity.

##### 10-K grounded facts (primary source)
- Vertiv states it “**leads with first-to-market designs engineered for next-gen rack-scale artificial intelligence (“AI”) compute**” and provides end-to-end power and cooling technologies for data centers and networks (**Item 1 — Business**).
- **2025 net sales were $10,229.9 million**, with **62% transacted in the Americas** and **20% in Asia Pacific** (**Item 1 — Business**). *China-specific revenue is not broken out here; treat regional exposure as a risk/unknown.*
- Vertiv reports **estimated combined order backlog of ~$15.0B as of Dec 31, 2025** (vs. $7.2B prior year) and says the majority is expected to ship within **12–18 months** (**Item 1 — Business; Item 1A — “We may not realize all of the sales expected from our backlog…”**).
- Vertiv spent **$441.7 million** on engineering/R&D in 2025 (**Item 1 — Business, ER&D**).

##### Price history context (trend only)
Stooq-based 10Y window (available since 2018-07-31): **~53.5% CAGR**, last close **$250.55**, ~**2% below** the period high (**$255.54**). Note: tool output is **not adjusted** for splits/dividends.

##### Key KPIs to watch
- Backlog level and **conversion / cancellations** (especially hyperscale/neocloud).
- Data-center end-market mix; evidence of **liquid cooling** adoption and attach rates.
- **Gross margin** and price/cost passthrough (materials, freight, labor).
- Services growth (recurring-ish) vs. product growth (more cyclical).

##### Main risks
- Demand timing: Vertiv explicitly flags variability from **AI spending shifts** and long sales cycles (**Item 1A**).
- Backlog risk: customers can **reduce/defer** firm orders; pricing changes may lag due to large backlog (**Item 1A**).
- Supply chain / global operations: significant manufacturing footprint across regions; exposure to tariffs/export controls and emerging-market volatility (**Item 1A**).
- **China exposure:** Asia Pacific is 20% of 2025 sales (Item 1). China-specific supply chain/revenue dependency is **unclear from extracted sections** → treat as **unknown**.

##### WATCHLIST action
**WATCHLIST — Accumulate only on pullbacks / verify China linkage.** Before sizing, do a deeper pass on notes/segment disclosures for PRC revenue, supplier concentration, and any export-control sensitivity.
