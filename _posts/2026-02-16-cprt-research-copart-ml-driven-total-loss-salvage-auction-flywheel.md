## Copart (CPRT)

# Copart (CPRT) — AI-enabled salvage auctions (adopter/enabler)

**Category:** adopter (AI inside core workflow) / enabler (data + marketplace infrastructure for claims/salvage)

## AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
Copart runs an online auction marketplace for salvage and used vehicles, tightly integrated into insurers’ total-loss and claims workflows. As insurers push harder on cycle-time reduction and automated claims handling, Copart benefits when machine learning/computer vision improves (1) *total-loss determination*, (2) *salvage value estimation*, and (3) *auction decisioning/price optimization*—all of which increase throughput and seller ROI. Better AI models can reduce “touch labor,” speed release-to-auction, and improve net proceeds, strengthening Copart’s value proposition and retention while expanding attach rate of its software tools.

## Grounded 10-K facts (primary source)
- Copart explicitly offers **Co.ai**, “a proprietary suite of total loss determination and valuation tools that leverage **machine learning and computer vision** … providing online salvage value estimates” to help sellers decide repair vs. total loss (**Item 1 – Salvage Estimation Services**).
- Copart also offers **IntelliSeller**, “an automated tool … Using **machine learning** … to determine when to establish minimum bid values and suggest when to re-auction a unit” to optimize returns and minimize cycle time (**Item 1 – IntelliSeller**).
- Business mix: for FY ended July 31, 2025, Copart generated **83.0% of revenue in the U.S. segment and 17.0% international** (**Item 1 – Our Business Segments**).

## 10-year price / trend context (not adjusted)
Stooq-based 10y window shows ~**23.7% CAGR** and ~**+734.7%** total return, but shares are ~**-41.8% from the high** and **below** the 50d and 200d SMAs (last close **$37.49** vs SMA50 **$39.52**, SMA200 **$45.81**). This reads as a quality compounder currently in a broad drawdown / de-rating phase.

## KPIs to watch
- Vehicle volumes processed/sold; total-loss frequency tailwinds.
- Seller adoption/penetration of **Co.ai** and **IntelliSeller** (any disclosed usage, attach rate, or uplift).
- International revenue mix and FX sensitivity.
- Service revenue per vehicle / take rate; operating leverage as automation increases.

## Main risks
- Tech/AI risk: competitors adopting AI faster; regulatory/legal uncertainty around AI/ML and GenAI use (**Item 1A – Rapid technological changes; emerging AI/ML/GenAI regulatory risks**).
- Cyber/availability risk for an internet auction platform (**Item 1A – IT disruptions/cyber incidents**).
- Regulatory/compliance risk (incl. DOJ money-laundering investigation noted in risk factors) (**Item 1A – Regulation of vehicle sales industry**).
- **China exposure:** no direct China mention found in extracted sections; supply-chain / buyer mix indirect exposure is **unknown** (treat as a monitoring item).

## WATCHLIST action
**WATCHLIST: ACCUMULATE-ON-WEAKNESS (starter position only).** Thesis is intact (AI embedded in core product + insurer automation tailwind). I’d wait for either (a) a trend break back above the 200d SMA, or (b) clear fundamental re-acceleration / margin expansion driven by automation, before sizing up.
