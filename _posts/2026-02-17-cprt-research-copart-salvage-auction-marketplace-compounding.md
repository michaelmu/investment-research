## Copart, Inc. (CPRT)

# Copart (CPRT) — online salvage auctions as a quiet compounding machine

**Thesis (high-growth compounder):** Copart runs a scaled, software-enabled marketplace for damaged/total-loss vehicles and other remarketed vehicles. The business blends network effects (more sellers → more inventory → more buyers → better price discovery) with an asset-backed moat (a growing yard/facility footprint + logistics + title-processing know-how). If salvage volumes keep rising with vehicle complexity and catastrophes, Copart can compound by taking share, adding services, and expanding internationally.

## What the 10‑K says (primary-source facts)
- **Seller mix is highly insurance-driven.** Copart states it obtained **81% of vehicles processed in fiscal 2025** from insurance company sellers (Form 10‑K, **Item 1 — Business**). That’s a strength (repeat volume, standardized workflow) and a concentration risk (pricing power and contract dynamics matter).
- **Profitability is already substantial.** For fiscal 2025, Copart reports **$4.6B of revenue and $1.7B of operating income** (Form 10‑K, **Item 1 — Business**), implying this isn’t a “story stock” — it’s an earnings engine funding reinvestment.
- **Demand is meaningfully global.** Copart notes that in fiscal 2025, **38.8% of U.S. vehicles (unit basis) were sold to international members** (Form 10‑K, **Item 1 — Business**). This supports price discovery, but also increases regulatory/trade/logistics exposure.

## Growth drivers & durability
- **Structural tailwinds:** Newer cars have more expensive components/sensors and are costlier to repair, making total losses more likely (10‑K Item 1 discussion of feature complexity). More total-loss decisions → more supply for Copart’s platform.
- **Operational flywheel:** Copart’s VB3 online auction model increases buyer pool without the cost of live auctions, potentially improving seller returns and keeping sellers sticky (10‑K Item 1).

## Key risks (watch closely)
- **International expansion risk:** Copart explicitly highlights risks from operating outside the U.S. as it expands in Europe, Canada, Brazil, and the Middle East (Form 10‑K, **Item 1A — Risk Factors**).
- **China exposure:** The 10‑K excerpted here does not call out China specifically; **direct China exposure appears low/unknown**, but international buyers could include China indirectly. Treat as a monitoring item.

## Price context (trend only; not adjusted)
Over the last ~10 years, CPRT shows ~**23.7% CAGR** and ~**+739% total return** on unadjusted Stooq OHLC, though it’s currently ~**42% below** the 10‑year high (price_history.py, 10y window).

**WATCHLIST:** **ADD** — Scaled, profitable marketplace with a clear structural tailwind; monitor insurance-seller concentration and international/regulatory risk.
