## Datadog (DDOG)

# Datadog (DDOG) — Observability platform with land-and-expand economics

**Thesis (why it can compound):** Datadog sits on the critical path of modern software delivery: it collects and correlates telemetry (metrics, traces, logs, user sessions, security signals) across increasingly complex cloud/hybrid stacks. When a platform becomes the “single pane of glass” for reliability + security, it tends to earn durable budget share, expand with customer workloads, and cross-sell adjacent modules.

**What the 10‑K says (grounding facts):**
- Datadog describes itself as an “AI‑powered observability and security platform for cloud applications,” integrating infrastructure monitoring, APM, logs, user experience monitoring, cloud security and other capabilities into one SaaS platform (10‑K Item 1, *Business — Overview*).
- Scale and growth: the company reports **approximately 32,700 customers in over 160 countries** as of **Dec 31, 2025** (10‑K Item 1, *Business — Key Benefits to Our Customers*). It also discloses revenue of **$3,427.2M in 2025** vs **$2,684.3M in 2024** and **$2,128.4M in 2023** (10‑K Item 1A, *Risk Factors — Risks Associated with our Growth*).

**Business model / moat angle:** Datadog emphasizes a **“land-and-expand”** motion with short time-to-value and self-serve expansion as customers add hosts and increase data volumes (10‑K Item 1). In observability, switching costs are less about contracts and more about operational dependence: dashboards, alerts, incident workflows, and institutional trust built from years of telemetry. The platform’s breadth (1,000+ integrations; multiple modules) also supports suite pull-through.

**Risks to underwrite:**
- **Competition + pricing pressure** is explicit (cloud providers’ native tools; New Relic/Dynatrace/Elastic/etc.) (10‑K Item 1, *Competition*).
- **Growth deceleration** is explicitly expected as the business matures (10‑K Item 1A).
- **China exposure:** the 10‑K notes customers in 160+ countries but this extract doesn’t quantify China-specific revenue or operations. Marking as **unknown**; treat as a diligence item (potential demand, compliance, or data-localization risk).

**10‑year price context (trend only):** Stooq history back to DDOG’s 2019 IPO shows **~19.6% CAGR** over the available window, with the stock about **41% below its prior high** and below both the 50‑ and 200‑day moving averages at the time of pull (not adjusted for splits/dividends; trend context only).
