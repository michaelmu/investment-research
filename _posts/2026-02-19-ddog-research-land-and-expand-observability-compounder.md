## Datadog, Inc. (DDOG)

# Datadog (DDOG) — “Land-and-expand” observability compounder

**Thesis (high-growth compounder lens):** Datadog sells a unified, usage-oriented SaaS platform that sits on the critical path of modern software operations (monitoring/observability + security). The product footprint can start small (one team, one use-case) and then naturally expands across logs/metrics/traces, more workloads, and adjacent modules (security, service management). That creates a credible *compounding* mechanism: rising customer usage + cross-sell, supported by a large and still-growing IT operations market.

**What the 10‑K says (grounded facts):**
- Datadog reports **revenue of $3,427.2M (2025), $2,684.3M (2024), and $2,128.4M (2023)** (Form 10‑K, **Item 7 / MD&A**). The same MD&A section notes **net income of $107.7M (2025)** and **operating cash flow of $1,050.1M (2025)**, with **free cash flow of $914.7M (2025)** (Item 7).
- The business has meaningful enterprise scaling signals: as of **Dec 31, 2025**, Datadog had **~4,310 customers with ARR ≥ $100k (90% of ARR)** and **~603 customers with ARR ≥ $1.0M**, up from 3,610 and 462 respectively a year earlier (Form 10‑K, **Item 7 / MD&A – key metrics**).

**Moat / durability:** Datadog emphasizes an integrated data platform (metrics/traces/logs + many product modules) and **“over 1,000 integrations”** (Form 10‑K, **Item 1 – Business**). Integrations + switching costs + broader deployment are the real defensive wall here—teams build dashboards/alerts/workflows and then want to standardize across the org.

**Price context (trend only):** Public data since the 2019 IPO shows a strong long-run uptrend but high volatility: **~+215% total return** since first available history, **~‑41% from the peak**, and currently **below the 50/200‑day moving averages** (price_history.py; not split/dividend adjusted).

**China exposure check:** The 10‑K describes global operations and customers in **160+ countries** (Item 1). It does not clearly quantify China revenue/exposure in the extracted sections here—**China exposure: unknown (treat as a risk)**.

**WATCHLIST:** **Keep** — sticky platform + expanding enterprise penetration + strong cash generation; monitor valuation sensitivity and any undisclosed China concentration.
