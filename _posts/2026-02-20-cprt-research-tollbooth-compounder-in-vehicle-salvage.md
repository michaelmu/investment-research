## Copart (CPRT)

# Copart (CPRT) — tollbooth compounder in salvage/remarketing

**Thesis (high-level):** Copart is a “pick-and-shovel” compounder in the auto insurance salvage ecosystem. It runs an online auction marketplace and related logistics/services that insurers, rebuilders, dismantlers, exporters, and the public rely on. The core compounding engine is marketplace scale + yard network + workflow software (VB3), which tends to drive higher recoveries for sellers and better selection/liquidity for buyers.

## What the 10‑K says (grounding)
- **Business model and customer concentration:** Copart states it is a leading global provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services and that **insurance companies supplied ~81% of the total vehicles processed in fiscal 2025** (also 81% in 2024, 83% in 2023). *(10‑K Item 1 / Item 7 Overview)*
- **Economics / profitability:** Copart reports **fiscal 2025 revenue of ~$4.6B and operating income of ~$1.7B**. That’s “real” operating leverage rather than purely accounting optics. *(10‑K Item 1 Business)*
- **Structural tailwinds:** In MD&A, Copart links growth to **total-loss frequency** and notes the **average age of cars on the road increased to 12.8 years in 2025 (from 11.1 in 2012)**, alongside rising repair complexity/costs—conditions that can push more claims toward “total loss.” *(10‑K Item 7 Key Financial Performance Measures)*

## Why it can compound
- **Network effects + switching costs:** Sellers want the broadest buyer pool (better recoveries); buyers want the deepest inventory. Copart’s yard footprint plus standardized processes/technology reinforces that flywheel.
- **Fee-based, asset-lite-ish mix (relative):** In many geographies Copart acts as an agent and earns auction/transaction and ancillary fees (storage, delivery, title processing). Where it does act as principal (select markets), that adds inventory/price risk—but the core engine remains services/marketplace.

## China exposure check
No China operations are listed in the 10‑K’s operations footprint (U.S., U.K., Germany, Brazil, Canada, UAE, Spain, Finland, Oman, Ireland, Bahrain). **However, Copart explicitly serves registered buyers “anywhere in the world,” and a portion of U.S. units sell to “International members.”** China-specific demand is **unknown** from the excerpts reviewed; treat as a monitoring risk (export policy, FX, international demand).

## Price context (10y trend; unadjusted)
Over the last ~10 years, CPRT shows ~**23.6% CAGR** and ~**+728% total return** (unadjusted). It’s currently **~42% below the 10y high** and **below its 200‑day SMA** (trend headwind, potential opportunity). *(stooq via price_history.py; trend context only)*

**WATCHLIST:** **ADD** — durable marketplace economics + strong profitability; monitor international/export mix and any China-linked buyer demand as an “unknown” risk.
