## Eaton (ETN)

# Eaton (ETN) — electrical power "pickaxes" for AI data centers

**Category:** Pickaxe / enabler (power distribution, protection, and electrical systems that scale data center capacity)

## AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
AI training/inference growth increases **data center power density** and accelerates the buildout/retrofit cycle for electrical infrastructure (switchgear, breakers, UPS/power management, monitoring). Eaton’s upside is largely **2nd-order**: it sells the “power side” of compute—equipment and systems that must be installed before GPU racks can be energized safely and reliably. If hyperscalers and colocation providers keep expanding capacity, Eaton should see higher demand in its electrical segments via project-driven orders, pull-through service, and pricing/mix benefits in higher-spec gear.

## Grounded 10‑K facts (primary source)
- Eaton describes itself as an “**intelligent power management company**” and explicitly lists making products for the **data center** market, alongside utility/industrial/commercial/aerospace and mobility end markets (10‑K **Item 1: Business**).
- Eaton reports **revenues of nearly $25 billion in 2024** and states it serves customers in **more than 160 countries** (10‑K **Item 1: Business**).
- China exposure to note: Eaton discloses equity-method investments in China, including a **50% stake in Jiangsu Huineng Electric’s circuit breaker business** and a **49% stake in Jiangsu Ryan Electrical (transformers)** (10‑K **Item 8: Financial Statements, Note 2 — Acquisitions**). These may be non-controlling, but they are direct China-linked assets.

## Price/trend context (10y)
ETN has compounded strongly over the last decade (10y **CAGR ~23.8%**; last close **$391.91** vs 10y low **~$44.45**). Shares are ~**4% below** the 10y high and above 50/200d SMAs (~15% / ~12%), suggesting an extended but still upward trend.

## KPIs to watch
- Electrical segment **organic sales / orders / backlog** (especially data center & utility commentary)
- **Operating margin** in Electrical Americas/Global (mix + pricing vs input costs)
- **Copper/steel** inflation passthrough (gross margin resilience)
- Data center capex signals: hyperscaler/colo buildouts, power-availability constraints

## Main risks
- **China exposure:** disclosed equity stakes in Chinese manufacturing (Item 8, Note 2). If “avoid China” is strict, treat as a material diligence item.
- End-market cyclicality and “**technology disruption**” impacting data-center-related demand (10‑K **Item 1A: Risk Factors**).
- Supply chain/input cost volatility (metals/components) and project timing risk (Item 1A).

## WATCHLIST action
**WATCH** (not a fresh add on valuation alone after a big run). Bias to add on: (1) evidence of sustained data center orders/backlog, and (2) multiple compression / pullback without margin deterioration. If China exposure is unacceptable, **defer** pending position-level disclosure and segment materiality.
