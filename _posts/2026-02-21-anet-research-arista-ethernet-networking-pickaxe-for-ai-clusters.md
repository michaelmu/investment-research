# Arista Networks (ANET) — AI data-center networking “pickaxe”

**Company / ticker:** Arista Networks (ANET)  
**Category:** Pickaxe / enabler (AI cluster networking)

## AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
AI training/inference is turning data-center networks into a first-class bottleneck: moving parameters/activations/checkpoints across thousands of accelerators demands *lossless, high-bandwidth, low-latency, power‑efficient* fabrics. Arista is positioned to monetize (1) the ongoing buildout of “AI Centers” by hyperscalers and AI neoclouds and (2) a multi-year transition toward Ethernet-based AI cluster networking (vs. proprietary fabrics), selling higher-speed switching (e.g., 800G) plus software/telemetry that improves utilization and time-to-first-job.

## Grounding from the 10‑K (primary-source facts)
- **Customer concentration is material.** *Two customers accounted for more than 10% of 2025 sales; they represented **26%** and **16%** of total revenue* (Item 1, Business). This cuts both ways: AI capex cycles at a small number of buyers can swing results.
- **Manufacturing/supply chain is global with some China linkage.** Arista discloses its products are *primarily manufactured in **Malaysia, Vietnam, and Mexico***, and it *procures a limited number of products originating from **China** (and also Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines); contract manufacturers also procure some components from China* (Item 1A, Risk Factors). Given the mandate to avoid meaningful China exposure, I treat this as a **risk factor** (scope not fully quantified).

## Key KPIs to watch
- Revenue growth + gross margin (AI “scale-out” cycle strength vs. pricing pressure)
- Mix/attachment of high-speed data-center products (800G+), and software/services adoption (CloudVision / AIOps)
- Customer concentration (share of revenue from top 2 customers) and A/R concentration
- Supply-chain stability (lead times, component costs) and tariff/export-control impacts

## Main risks
- Hyperscaler digestion/capex pauses (high customer concentration)
- Competitive displacement / pricing pressure in switching
- **China-related trade/export control/tariff shocks** + component sourcing through contract manufacturers (Item 1A)

## Price context (10y trend; unadjusted)
ANET has compounded strongly over the last decade (**~41.7% CAGR**). Last close **$132.79**, about **19.5%** below the 10y high (**$164.94**). (Stooq; unadjusted for splits/dividends.)

## WATCHLIST action
**WATCH:** Keep ANET on the AI-enabler list; look for (a) sustained 800G/AI-center demand without margin compression and (b) any disclosure tightening around China-origin components/tariff sensitivity.
