## Axon Enterprise (AXON)

# AXON (Axon Enterprise) — hardware-to-SaaS public-safety compounder

**Thesis (why it could compound):** Axon is building an integrated “public safety operating system” that pairs mission-critical hardware (TASER devices, body/in-car cameras, drones/robotics) with sticky, cloud-hosted evidence and workflow software. The compounding setup is the classic land-and-expand flywheel: device deployments create ongoing cloud subscriptions (storage, digital evidence management, workflow, AI) and upgrades.

**10-K grounded facts (FY ended 2024-12-31):**
- Axon reported **annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1.0B as of Dec 31, 2024** (Form 10‑K, **Item 1 – Business**, Software revenue drivers section; ARR defined as monthly recurring license/integration/warranty/storage revenue annualized).
- In **2024 total net sales were $2.083B vs. $1.561B in 2023 (+33.4%)** (Form 10‑K, **Item 7 – MD&A**, net sales table). The 10‑K also breaks out growth by segment: **Software & Sensors** net sales were **$1.264B** and **TASER** net sales were **$818.7M** in 2024 (Item 7).

**Business quality notes:**
- Recurring mix appears to be rising: cloud services ("Axon Evidence and Cloud Services") is the largest line item inside Software & Sensors at **$808.3M** in 2024 (Item 7).
- Customer concentration risk is limited: **no customer represented >10% of total net sales** in 2024/2023/2022 (Item 1).
- The company emphasizes IP defensibility: as of Dec 31, 2024 it disclosed **330+ U.S. patents and 270+ international patents** (Item 1).

**Key risks / what to watch:**
- **Regulatory & liability:** The 10‑K notes the **ATF regulates the TASER 10 CED as a firearm** due to its propulsion design, requiring Axon to maintain a federal firearms license and comply with associated rules (Item 1). Any broader reclassification / restrictions could affect demand and margins.
- **Government budget cyclicality:** municipal and federal budget cycles can create lumpiness (Item 1).
- **China exposure:** Axon lists multiple international offices (Item 1) but does not clearly quantify China revenue in the extracted sections. **Treat China exposure as *unknown*; main risk is supply chain component sourcing and potential indirect sales channels.**

**10-year price context (trend only):** Over the last 10 years AXON shows ~**38% CAGR** and ~**‑58.5% max drawdown**; the last close was **$429.67**, ~**‑51.5% from the 10‑yr high** (price_history.py summary; unadjusted OHLC).

**WATCHLIST: ADD** — high-growth + recurring revenue flywheel with strong share-of-wallet expansion potential; monitor regulatory risk around TASER 10 and evidence/records software competitive intensity.
