## ServiceNow (NOW)

# ServiceNow (NOW) — workflow “operating system” for the AI era

*Not financial advice.*

## Why it’s an interesting compounder
ServiceNow is essentially selling a horizontal “workflow OS” for large enterprises: a single platform that connects people, processes, and data so work can be automated across IT, security, customer service, HR/finance, and industry workflows. The durable part isn’t just features—it’s the integration layer and the governance/controls enterprises need when workflows span many systems of record.

In its latest 10‑K, management frames AI as an accelerant: AI is good at generating information, but turning that into outcomes requires orchestration, approvals, compliance rules, and integrations across systems (10‑K, Item 1 “Business” overview). That positioning matters because it’s aligned to where AI deployments often stall—execution and governance, not “answers.”

## What the 10‑K says (grounded facts)
- **Scale and customer base:** As of **Dec 31, 2025**, ServiceNow reported **~8,700 customers** (10‑K, Item 1 “Business”). This supports the idea that it’s already a mainstream platform inside large orgs, not a niche point product.
- **Revenue model and growth:** For FY **2025**, ServiceNow reported **$13.278B total revenue**, with **$12.883B (97%)** from subscriptions, up **21%** year‑over‑year (10‑K, Item 7 “MD&A — Revenues”). A subscription-heavy mix is typical of compounding software models when retention + expansion are strong.
- **Forward demand indicator:** ServiceNow disclosed **$28.2B** of total non‑cancellable **remaining performance obligations (RPO)** and expects to recognize **~46% within the next 12 months** (10‑K, Item 8, Note “Deferred Revenue and Performance Obligations”). RPO isn’t revenue, but it is a concrete signal of contracted backlog.

## Risks / watch‑outs
- **Valuation + cyclicality:** High‑multiple software can de-rate in risk-off environments even if fundamentals remain healthy.
- **Execution risk in AI packaging/pricing:** The 10‑K highlights competitive intensity and evolving pricing models (10‑K, Item 1A “Risk Factors”). If “agentic AI” becomes commoditized, differentiation must come from workflow depth and trust.
- **China exposure:** ServiceNow operates internationally and has data centers in Asia (10‑K, Item 1 mentions global data centers). **Direct China revenue exposure is not clearly quantified in the extracted sections → treat as *unknown* and a risk** under the mandate.

## 10‑year price context (trend only)
Over the last ~10 years, NOW shows a **~25.7% CAGR** with a **~57% max drawdown** and is currently **~56% below** its prior high (price_history.py summary; unadjusted OHLC). This looks like a classic compounder chart with violent cycles—useful context for entry timing discipline.

## WATCHLIST
**Action: KEEP / ADD** — High-quality subscription compounder with a clear “AI needs workflow orchestration + governance” wedge; monitor for any disclosed China concentration and for AI monetization durability.

**Not financial advice.**
