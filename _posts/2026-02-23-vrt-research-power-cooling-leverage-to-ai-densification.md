# Vertiv (VRT) — “Power & cooling leverage to AI densification”

**Category:** Pickaxe / enabler (critical digital infrastructure).

## AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
AI training/inference is pushing **higher rack power density** and more stringent uptime requirements in data centers. That directly increases demand for Vertiv’s **power management (UPS/switchgear/busway)** and **thermal management (air + liquid cooling)** systems, plus recurring services. The “second/third-order” angle: even if specific GPU/accelerator winners rotate, **watts and heat still have to be delivered and removed**, and AI densification tends to make the infrastructure bill (and complexity) rise.

## 10‑K grounding (primary-source facts)
- Vertiv positions itself as “**first-to-market designs engineered for next-gen rack-scale artificial intelligence (AI) compute**,” offering end-to-end power and cooling technologies for data centers and networks (**Item 1 — Business**).
- Demand has translated into a sharply higher order book: **combined order backlog was $15.0B at Dec 31, 2025 vs $7.2B at Dec 31, 2024**, and management expects most of it to ship within **12–18 months** (**Item 1 — Backlog**; also discussed in **Item 1A** risk factor on backlog realization).
- Scale/commitment to innovation: **ER&D spend was $441.7M in 2025** (**Item 1 — Engineering, Research and Development**).
- Geographic mix flags non-trivial Asia exposure: 2025 net sales were **$10.23B**, with **20% transacted in Asia Pacific** (**Item 1 — Business / Segments**).

## Price context (trend only; not adjusted)
Over the last ~10 years available in the tool window (data from 2018-07-31), VRT shows **very strong uptrend**: ~**53.5% CAGR**, last close **$250.55**, ~**2% below** the period high (**$255.54**) and **~66% above** its 200‑day SMA (**price_history tool; 10y window**).

## KPIs to watch
- Backlog growth vs conversion (book-to-bill; cancellations/deferrals).
- Data center revenue mix and services attach/renewal rates.
- Gross margin trajectory (pricing vs component/expedite costs).
- Working capital (inventory + receivables) as capacity ramps.

## Main risks (incl. China constraint)
- **China/Asia-Pacific exposure:** 20% of sales transacted in Asia Pacific; the filing also describes a meaningful manufacturing footprint there (**Item 1**). **China-specific revenue/supply-chain dependency is not clearly quantified in the extracted sections** → treat as **UNKNOWN** and a key diligence item.
- Cyclicality/air pockets if AI capex pauses; Vertiv explicitly calls out sensitivity to “shifts in the level or focus of spending on artificial intelligence” (**Item 1A — Risk Factors**).
- Execution risk on large, penalty-bearing projects and supply constraints (**Item 1A**).

## WATCHLIST action
**WATCH (not add yet):** Keep on the AI infrastructure list, but **require a China-exposure pass** (revenue + sourcing + manufacturing) before upgrading to “low-China-risk” status. If backlog converts cleanly and margins hold while capex expands, VRT remains a prime AI-densification pickaxe.
