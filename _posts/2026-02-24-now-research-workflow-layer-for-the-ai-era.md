## ServiceNow (NOW)

# ServiceNow (NOW) — workflow layer for the AI era

**Thesis (compounder lens):** ServiceNow sells a mission‑critical, sticky “workflow operating system” for large enterprises. As companies deploy more AI, the scarce piece is not insight generation—it’s *governed execution* across systems of record. That is exactly what ServiceNow’s platform is built to orchestrate, which can support durable multi-year expansion (more modules, more seats, more workflows) inside a customer base that tends to standardize on one platform.

**What the business is:** ServiceNow provides a cloud platform that connects people, processes, and data to automate cross‑functional workflows (IT, security, risk, CRM/service, HR, finance, etc.) and is positioning “Now Assist” and AI agents as a productivity layer on top (10‑K Item 1: Business). The practical moat is deep integration + workflow orchestration that’s hard to rip out once embedded in day‑to‑day operations.

**Two grounding facts from the latest 10‑K:**
- **Backlog / durability:** As of **Dec 31, 2025, remaining performance obligations (RPO) were $28.2B**, and **46%** was expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months; management also states RPO and current RPO grew **27%** and **25%** year over year (10‑K **Item 7**: MD&A, “Remaining performance obligations”).
- **Large-customer expansion:** ServiceNow reports **603 customers with ACV > $5M** as of Dec 31, 2025 (up from 502 in 2024) (10‑K **Item 7**: MD&A, “Number of customers with ACV greater than $5 million”).

**Growth/quality signals to watch:** The business is predominantly subscription revenue with multi‑year contracts and generally non‑cancellable terms (10‑K Item 7 discusses subscription revenue recognition and contracting structure). International revenue is meaningful: sales outside North America were **37% of total revenues** in 2025 (10‑K Item 1A / risk discussion references this), so FX and regional execution matter.

**Price context (not advice):** Over the last 10 years, NOW shows ~**25% CAGR** and ~**57% max drawdown**; it is currently ~**56% below** its 10‑year high per the unadjusted price history snapshot (stooq via `price_history.py`). This supports “great business, volatile stock” expectations.

**China exposure:** *Unknown.* The 10‑K excerpted here emphasizes international exposure in aggregate (37% outside North America), but does not clearly quantify China specifically. Treat as a diligence item (customer mix, partners, data residency).

**Risks (headline):** platform competition (hyperscalers / SaaS suites), AI execution risk (quality, governance, security), and international/regulatory complexity.

**WATCHLIST:** **ADD** — high-quality enterprise workflow platform with strong RPO and increasing >$5M ACV customers; diligence China-specific exposure and valuation sensitivity.
