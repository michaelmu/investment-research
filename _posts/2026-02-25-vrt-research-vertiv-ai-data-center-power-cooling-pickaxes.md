## Vertiv (VRT)

# Vertiv (VRT) — power & cooling “pickaxes” for AI data centers

**Company / ticker:** Vertiv Holdings Co (**VRT**)  
**Category:** Pickaxe / enabler (critical digital infrastructure)

## AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
AI training and inference clusters push data centers toward **higher rack densities** and more complex power/thermal architectures. Vertiv sells the “plumbing” that must scale alongside compute: **power management (UPS, switchgear, busbar, rack PDU)** and **thermal management (air + liquid cooling)** plus installation and lifecycle service. As GPU/accelerator deployments increase, the share of project spend that goes to power + cooling + services tends to rise, and upgrade cycles can be recurring (retrofits, capacity expansions, efficiency improvements).

## Grounding in the 10‑K (primary-source facts)
- Vertiv states it “design[s], manufacture[s], sell[s], install[s], maintain[s], and service[s] critical digital infrastructure” and highlights “**first-to-market designs engineered for next-gen rack-scale artificial intelligence (‘AI’) compute**.” (Item 1 — *Business / Our Business*)
- Demand/visibility: Vertiv reports estimated **combined order backlog of $15.0B** as of **Dec 31, 2025** (vs. $7.2B Dec 31, 2024), with the majority expected to ship in **12–18 months**. (Item 1 — *Business / Backlog*; Item 1A also references backlog risk)
- Scale: 2025 **net sales were $10,229.9M**, with **20% transacted in Asia Pacific** (62% Americas, 18% EMEA). (Item 1 — *Business / Segments & Net Sales mix*)

## Key KPIs to watch
- Backlog level + conversion (book-to-bill; cancellations/deferrals)
- Data-center end-market mix: hyperscale/colocation/neocloud exposure
- Gross margin / pricing vs. input costs (copper, aluminum, components, freight)
- Services attach rate and services margin (lifecycle recurring revenue)

## Main risks (incl. China-exposure screen)
- **Asia Pacific revenue + manufacturing footprint**: Vertiv has operations in Asia Pacific and cites emerging-market competition (including **China/India** manufacturers) and global supply-chain exposure. Exact China revenue/supplier dependency is **not fully quantified in the excerpts here → treat as “unknown” and a risk**. (Item 1 — *Facilities/Supply Chain*; Item 1A — *Global scope / trade / tariffs*)
- Capex cyclicality: a slowdown or refocus in AI/data-center buildouts can hit demand. (Item 1A — *customers/industry; AI spend shifts*)
- Execution: long project cycles, fixed-price/turnkey contract risk, and penalties for delays or failures. (Item 1A)

## Price / trend context (not a valuation call)
Available history in the tool begins **2018-07-31**. Over that window, VRT shows ~**+2448%** total return with ~**-71%** max drawdown; last close ~$250.6 and above the 200‑day SMA in the summary. (price_history tool)

## WATCHLIST action
**WATCHLIST: Add / keep.** I’d look for continued backlog conversion without margin erosion, and for disclosures clarifying **China-linked revenue/supply-chain concentration**.
