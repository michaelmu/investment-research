## Eaton (ETN)

# Eaton (ETN) — “Data-center power stack” enabler

**Category:** Pickaxe / enabler (electrical infrastructure for AI data centers)

## AI tailwind thesis (mechanism)
AI training/inference growth is driving a step-change in **data-center power density** and **electrical complexity** (utility interconnects, switchgear, breakers, busway, UPS/power quality, distribution, monitoring). Eaton is positioned as a core supplier across that power chain. The specific AI linkage is not “Eaton uses AI,” but that **AI workloads require more megawatts per site**, which pulls forward multi‑year spend on electrical equipment and services. This is a 2nd‑order beneficiary: hyperscalers and colocation players spend on compute, then must build/upgrade the power room to match.

## 10‑K grounding (primary-source facts)
- Eaton explicitly highlights **data centers** as a key end market: it “make[s] products for the **data center**, utility, industrial, commercial…” markets and is “benefiting from momentum in the **data center** and utility end markets” (Item 1, *Business*).
- Scale/financial context: Eaton reports “revenues of **nearly $25 billion in 2024**” and serves customers in “more than **160 countries**” (Item 1, *Business*).
- Customer concentration reminder (useful for cycle risk): in 2024, **Electrical Americas + Electrical Global** had **26% of sales to eight large customers** of electrical products/systems/services (Item 1, segment discussion).
- Risk framing: Eaton notes it supports “cutting edge technology… including… **data centers**” and that abrupt disruptive technologies could negatively impact end markets and its stock price (Item 1A, *Risk Factors — Technology disruption*).

## Price/trend context (10y)
ETN has been in a strong long-duration uptrend: ~**24% 10‑yr CAGR**, last close **$391.91**, about **4% below** its 10‑yr high, and **~12% above** its 200‑day SMA (stooq; not dividend-adjusted).

## Key KPIs to watch
- Electrical segment **organic sales growth** and **operating margin** (especially any commentary on data-center mix).
- **Backlog / orders** trends in Electrical (if disclosed) and lead-time normalization.
- Working capital: **inventory** and **receivables** (signal of demand vs channel fill).

## Main risks
- **China exposure:** Eaton is global (160+ countries; manufacturing in 34 countries per Item 2). Specific China revenue/supply-chain dependency is **unknown from the excerpts reviewed**—treat as a diligence risk (especially for electronics/components).
- Capex cycle risk: data-center builds can pause; customer concentration can amplify volatility.
- Supply chain / commodity input costs (copper, steel, electronic components) and pricing power (Item 1 + Item 1A).

## WATCHLIST action
**WATCH / Accumulate on pullbacks**: keep ETN on the AI-infrastructure watchlist; look for confirmation via sustained Electrical growth and management commentary that data-center demand remains incremental (not merely cyclical catch-up).
