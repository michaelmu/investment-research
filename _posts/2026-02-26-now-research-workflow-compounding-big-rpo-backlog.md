## ServiceNow (NOW)

# ServiceNow (NOW) — workflow “system of action” for the AI era

ServiceNow is an enterprise workflow automation platform that sits between “insight” (data/AI) and “execution” (approvals, routing, updates to systems of record). The company frames its moat as durable enterprise relationships plus a single platform architecture that connects people, processes, and data across departments (IT, security, HR, finance, customer service, etc.). The core bet is that as AI proliferates, enterprises need *governed orchestration* more than yet another model—i.e., tooling that turns AI output into compliant, auditable work.

**What the 10‑K says (grounding facts):**
- **Visibility into forward revenue is sizable.** As of **Dec 31, 2025, remaining performance obligations (RPO) were $28.2B, with 46% expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months** (10‑K Item 7 / MD&A, “Remaining performance obligations”). Management also notes RPO and current RPO grew **27% and 25% YoY**, respectively (same section).
- **Revenue model is subscription-first with sticky contract terms.** The company states it derives revenue “predominately from subscription revenues,” recognized ratably over the subscription term for cloud services; and that customer contracts are **generally non‑cancellable** during the term (10‑K Item 7 / MD&A, “Subscription revenues”).
- **Go-to-market remains heavily direct.** Revenues from the direct sales organization represented **78% of total revenues in 2025 and 2024** (10‑K Item 7 / MD&A, “Revenues from our direct sales organization”).

**Price context (not fundamentals, just tape):**
Over the last 10 years, NOW shows a strong compounding profile: **~25.3% 10‑yr CAGR** and **~+848% total return** (Stooq data via price_history tool). The stock is currently **~56% below its 10‑yr high** and **below both 50‑ and 200‑day SMAs**, implying the market is discounting growth durability/valuation (trend context only).

**China exposure:** Not explicitly called out in the extracted 10‑K sections I reviewed; treat **China exposure as unknown** (risk: international customers, partners, and FX).

**Thesis in one line:** If ServiceNow keeps winning as the cross‑enterprise workflow control plane (especially for AI governance + orchestration), it can compound via multi‑product expansion inside large customers with high switching costs.

**WATCHLIST: ADD** — High-quality subscription compounder with large contracted backlog (RPO) and strong long-run price compounding; currently in a major drawdown worth monitoring for re‑entry.
