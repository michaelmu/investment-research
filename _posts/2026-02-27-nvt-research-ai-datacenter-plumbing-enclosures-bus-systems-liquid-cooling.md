# nVent Electric (NVT) — “AI datacenter plumbing” via enclosures, bus systems, and liquid cooling

**Category:** pickaxe / enabler  
**Not financial advice.**

## AI tailwind thesis (2nd/3rd-order)
As AI training/inference pushes datacenter power density higher, the bottlenecks migrate from “chips” to **power delivery, thermal management, and physical protection**. nVent sells the “hard” electrical infrastructure that gets built *because* AI workloads require more racks, more MW per site, and tighter uptime targets: bus systems, switchgear, power distribution, enclosures, and **liquid + air cooling**. This is a classic capex pickaxe: if hyperscalers and colocation players keep building, nVent’s content per datacenter can rise with complexity (higher power, more redundant distribution, more cooling and protection).

## Grounding in the 10-K (primary source)
Filing: **Form 10-K** | **filingDate:** 2026-02-17 | **reportDate:** 2025-12-31 | **accession:** 0001628280-26-008608.

1) nVent explicitly links its Systems Protection offering to datacenters and AI-driven digitalization: it describes Systems Protection as serving “mission critical applications, including **data centers**” and states that “digitalization, including increased use of **artificial intelligence**, [is] helping to drive the need for our products,” including enclosures, switchgear, power distribution and “cooling solutions, both **liquid and air**” (**Item 1, Business**).

2) Demand visibility jumped: total backlog at 12/31/2025 was **$2.3499B** vs **$0.7493B** at 12/31/2024, with Systems Protection backlog **$2.1189B** (up 218% YoY). Management attributes the increase “primarily [to] the acquisition of the Electrical Products Group and the **growth of our data centers business**” (**Item 1, Business**).

3) Scale + mix: 2025 net sales were **$3.893B** (+29.5% YoY), and management notes Systems Protection / Electrical Connections represented ~**67% / 33%** of 2025 revenues. They call out that megatrends including AI “have led to sales growth, particularly in the infrastructure vertical… including our **data centers** business” (**Item 7, MD&A**).

## Key KPIs to track
- Systems Protection backlog and backlog-to-sales (early signal for datacenter cycle)
- Organic growth in the “infrastructure vertical” (management highlights this driver)
- Gross margin progression (2025 margin pressured by inflation/tariffs + capacity investments)
- Datacenter-related mix/content: bus systems, switchgear, liquid cooling attach rate (watch disclosures & segment commentary)

## Risks / things to diligence (incl. China exposure)
- **China supply chain exposure:** the company states it sources materials/components/finished goods from outside the U.S., “including… **China**” (**Item 1A, Risk Factors**). Treat as a real risk until quantified (tariffs, geopolitics, substitution costs).
- Customer concentration / cyclicality: hyperscaler capex and project timing can swing; backlog timing can slip (**Item 1A** discusses backlog timing and cancellation risk).
- Integration risk: large acquisitions (e.g., Electrical Products Group) can dilute margins or distract execution (**Item 1A**).

## 10-year price context (trend only)
From the available 10y window (starts 2018-05-03): total return ~**+471%**, CAGR ~**25%**; last close **$118.86**, about **-3.3%** off the window high; above 200-day SMA by ~**26%** (source: stooq; OHLC not dividend-adjusted).

## WATCHLIST action
**ADD (candidate):** NVT fits the “AI beneficiaries” mandate as a datacenter electrification/thermal pickaxe. Before sizing any position, prioritize a quick supply-chain/geography diligence pass (explicit China sourcing risk noted in Item 1A) and look for any disclosure that quantifies datacenter exposure within Systems Protection.
